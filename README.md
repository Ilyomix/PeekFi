  - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for fetching and managing data, including the `useCryptoSearch` hook.
  - **`pages/`**: Contains the different page components, each representing a route in the application.
  - **`stores/`**: Manages global state using Zustand or another state management library.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers, such as API key management and data formatting functions.
- **`tests/`**: Contains test files to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **`package.json`**: Manages dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.
